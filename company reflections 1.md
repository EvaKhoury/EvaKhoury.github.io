I should try to write fiction. Who am I kidding, though? My mind treads close to life. The most interesting I can get is the dream/life interplay. Life then dream, life then dream. First, dinner with the head of HR at XXXXXXXXXX. Then, dreams of being chained to a megalomaniac pop star’s dinner table. All superfans and limousine drivers wanting to serve him, all discussing pride and life in servitude, the delirious joy in giving oneself up to something bigger. What is the bigger? A company? An idol? The idea of a country, or a god? It’s so wonderful to give oneself up. It’s fun to be in a cult. I love to watch the numbers go up, the tasks get done. I love to chop wood for the village. I love to lay my life down for others, to prostrate myself before the group. There is stability, clarity, a mind untroubled even as one self-sacrifices in this life. Whether it’s for profit, revolution, survival, it just depends on the time in which we live. An HR executive culling loved coworkers in a layoff of 10,000 in an apparent attempt to stave a massive company failure is not so different from a warrior razing one village to win a war, or the body’s immune system attacking and detaching processes to save the whole. To act like this is both selfless and evil.
I talked to XXXXX about human nature, because he loves to talk about that stuff (and so do I). His Christian view places greed as a fundamental part of humanity, as humans are all sinners in this mortal world. He expects a theocracy after the second coming of Christ, in a world that is free of sin and suffering. Until then, it’s sin all the way down. In offloading all hope to a theological coming that may or may not come in this life, he is thoroughly anti-revolutionary. He gets by in a business causing climate disaster. He churns out children while damning the world he lives in. He claims, “Capitalism is the only system that works”- not communism, or fascism, because it’s the only one that runs on greed. He’s smart enough to acknowledge capitalism as a thoroughly inefficient system, even idiotic. He’s an accountant. He sees the waste and the uselessness and violence of a system that only works on limitless growth, no pauses, no fallow periods, no cycles. But in his mind, this is our just desserts. In a world so apparently inescapably dominated by sin, it is the only way to live. By accepting these religious assertions he abandons hope in the mortal world, he even creates hell where he stands. He is happy.
It would do well for more people to understand the dogwhistles of the common American religious fanatic, to understand the headspace of the happy and stable workers in a machine of their own destruction. I can give some hints- get good enough at board game nights, start playing Risk and Age of Empires, make a few engineer friends who can’t talk about what they do for work, maybe someone who has a lot of kids.
